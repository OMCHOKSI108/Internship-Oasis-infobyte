Data Cleaning and Analysis Project Summary
=====================================

Project Overview
---------------
This project focused on cleaning and analyzing two distinct datasets:
1. New York City Airbnb Data (2019)
2. YouTube Trending Videos Data (US)

Datasets Used
------------
1. Airbnb Dataset:
   - Source: AB_NYC_2019.csv
   - Content: Listing activity and metrics in NYC for 2019
   - Size: Multiple columns including price, location, room type, etc.

2. YouTube Dataset:
   - Source: USvideos.csv
   - Content: Trending videos data with engagement metrics
   - Additional: Category mapping from US_category_id.json

Data Cleaning Process
-------------------
1. Airbnb Data Cleaning:
   - Handled missing values in name, host_name, last_review, and reviews_per_month
   - Filled missing names with "Unknown"
   - Set missing reviews_per_month to 0
   - Used most recent date for missing last_review dates
   - Removed price outliers using IQR method
   - Created clean dataset: airbnb_cleaned_data.csv

2. YouTube Data Cleaning:
   - Standardized date formats (trending_date and publish_time)
   - Cleaned text fields (title and channel_title)
   - Removed duplicate entries
   - Mapped category IDs to readable names
   - Created clean dataset: youtube_cleaned_data.csv

Analysis Performed
----------------
1. Airbnb Analysis:
   - Price distribution across neighborhoods
   - Room type distribution
   - Price analysis by neighborhood group
   - Room type pricing patterns

2. YouTube Analysis:
   - Video category distribution
   - Engagement metrics (views, likes, dislikes)
   - Category performance analysis
   - View-to-like correlation study

Key Findings
-----------
Airbnb Insights:
- Manhattan shows highest average prices
- Entire home/apartments are most common
- Clear price variations across neighborhoods
- Shared rooms are least common but most affordable

YouTube Insights:
- Entertainment videos dominate trending content
- Strong correlation between views and likes
- Entertainment and Music categories show highest engagement
- Educational content has lower representation

Tools and Technologies Used
-------------------------
- Python Libraries:
  * pandas: Data manipulation
  * numpy: Numerical operations
  * matplotlib/seaborn: Visualization
  * json: Category mapping
  
- Data Processing Techniques:
  * IQR method for outlier detection
  * DateTime standardization
  * Missing value imputation
  * Data visualization

Files Generated

1. airbnb_cleaned_data.csv: Clean version of Airbnb dataset
2. youtube_cleaned_data.csv: Clean version of YouTube dataset
3. Various visualizations and analysis plots

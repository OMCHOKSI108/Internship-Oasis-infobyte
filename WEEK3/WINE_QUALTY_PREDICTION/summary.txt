Wine Quality Prediction Project - Summary
=======================================

Project Overview
---------------
This project aims to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties using machine learning. We analyzed a dataset of wine samples, each rated on a scale from 3 to 8, along with their chemical characteristics.

Dataset Information
-----------------
- Total Features: 11 chemical properties
- Target Variable: Wine quality (scale 3-8)
- Key Features: Alcohol content, volatile acidity, sulphates, density, pH, etc.
- Sample Distribution: Mostly rated 5-6 (average quality), fewer samples of very high (7-8) or low (3-4) quality

What We Did
-----------
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning
   - Loaded and examined the wine quality dataset
   - Removed outliers using IQR method
   - Checked for missing values (none found)
   - Analyzed feature distributions and relationships

2. Data Visualization
   - Created distribution plots of wine quality
   - Generated correlation heatmap
   - Analyzed feature relationships with quality
   - Visualized volatile acidity vs quality through box plots

3. Model Development
   - Implemented three different classifiers:
     * Random Forest Classifier
     * Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
     * Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
   - Scaled features using StandardScaler

Key Findings
-----------
1. Feature Importance:
   - Alcohol content: Strongest positive correlation with quality
   - Volatile acidity: Strong negative correlation with quality
   - Sulphates: Moderate positive correlation with quality

2. Model Performance:
   - Random Forest performed best (Accuracy: ~70%)
   - Better at handling imbalanced classes
   - More robust to non-linear relationships

3. Chemical Insights:
   - Higher alcohol content generally indicates better quality
   - Lower volatile acidity associated with higher quality
   - Balanced sulphate levels contribute to better quality

Practical Applications
--------------------
- Quality control in wine production
- Automated wine grading systems
- Optimization of wine production process
- Guide for adjusting chemical properties during production

Future Improvements
-----------------
1. Model Enhancement:
   - Implement hyperparameter tuning
   - Address class imbalance using SMOTE
   - Try ensemble methods

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Create interaction features
   - Add more relevant chemical properties
   - Consider non-linear feature transformations

Business Value
-------------
This model can help wineries:
- Predict wine quality before the aging process
- Optimize production parameters
- Maintain consistent quality standards
- Reduce dependency on human tasters for initial screening

Technical Metrics
---------------
- Random Forest Model:
  * Accuracy: ~70%
  * Best performance on middle-range qualities (5-6)
  * Room for improvement in extreme qualities (3-4, 7-8)
- R2 Score: Shows good fit for numerical predictions
- RMSE: Indicates average prediction error

This project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real-world problems in the wine industry, providing valuable insights for quality prediction and process optimization.
